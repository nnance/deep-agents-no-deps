## Git Strategy

### Branch Structure
- `main` - stable releases
- `develop` - integration branch
- `feature/*` - feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - bug fix branches
- `release/*` - release preparation

### Commit Message Convention
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

### Version Strategy
- Follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Start at 0.1.0 (initial development)
- 1.0.0 when API is stable and feature-complete

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Component interaction testing
3. **E2E Tests** - Full system workflow testing
4. **Performance Tests** - Benchmarking and optimization

### Coverage Goals
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- 100% coverage for core components
- All public APIs must have tests

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All planned features implemented
- [ ] Test coverage >80%
- [ ] Documentation complete for all exports
- [ ] Zero critical bugs
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Examples running successfully
- [ ] CLI fully functional
- [ ] Dual module support working

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **LLM API Changes** - Abstract behind interfaces
2. **Performance Issues** - Profile early and often
3. **Memory Leaks** - Regular heap analysis
4. **Concurrency Issues** - Careful state management

### Mitigation Strategies
- Regular code reviews
- Incremental development
- Continuous testing
- Performance monitoring
- User feedback incorporation

## Next Steps

1. Set up the project repository
2. Begin Phase 0 immediately
3. Schedule weekly progress reviews
4. Adjust timeline based on actual progress
