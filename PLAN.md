# Deep Agent Package Development Plan

## Project Overview
A TypeScript-based Node.js package implementing a Deep Agent system with planning, sub-agents, file system access, and memory management capabilities. No external runtime dependencies, using only built-in Node.js modules. Target: Library for use in other Node.js applications.

## Git Strategy

### Branch Structure
- `main` - stable releases
- `develop` - integration branch
- `feature/*` - feature branches
- `bugfix/*` - bug fix branches
- `release/*` - release preparation

### Commit Message Convention
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

### Version Strategy
- Follow Semantic Versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Start at 0.1.0 (initial development)
- 1.0.0 when API is stable and feature-complete

## Testing Strategy

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests** - Individual component testing
2. **Integration Tests** - Component interaction testing
3. **E2E Tests** - Full system workflow testing
4. **Performance Tests** - Benchmarking and optimization

### Coverage Goals
- Minimum 70% code coverage (reduced for aggressive timeline)
- 100% coverage for core Ollama integration
- All public APIs must have basic tests

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All planned features implemented
- [ ] Test coverage >70%
- [ ] Documentation complete for all exports
- [ ] Zero critical bugs
- [ ] Basic performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Examples running successfully
- [ ] Dual module support working
- [ ] Library ready for integration

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Ollama API Changes** - Abstract behind interfaces
2. **Performance Issues** - Profile during development
3. **Memory Leaks** - Regular heap analysis
4. **Concurrency Issues** - Careful state management
5. **Sandboxing Security** - Strict path validation

### Mitigation Strategies
- Rapid iteration and testing
- Incremental development
- Continuous validation
- Early integration testing

## Next Steps

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Begin Phase 0 (Project Setup) - Target: 2-3 hours
2. Start with basic package.json and TypeScript setup
3. Get Ollama provider working first
4. Build incrementally, test continuously
5. Target total development time: 16-20 hours over 2-3 days

**Total Estimated Time: 16-20 Hours (2-3 intensive days)**

**Note**: This aggressive timeline focuses on MVP functionality. Advanced features (circuit breakers, comprehensive monitoring, etc.) are deferred for future iterations. Priority is on getting a working Deep Agent library that can be used and extended.
