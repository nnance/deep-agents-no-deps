Let's build a NodeJS package that implements 4 key components of a Deep Agent: planning, sub agents, file system access, and memory management in a general purpose way so that you can easily create a Deep Agent for your application.

Help me think through how to break this into iterative development phases and write a plan.md.

Requirements:

- Node.js, npm, TypeScript
- No external dependencies for runtime.   We will implement all functionality using built-in Node.js modules and TypeScript features.
- Integrate with multiple LLM providers (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)
- The planning component should allow for defining and managing tasks via an internally managed to do list.  It should have a verification step to ensure the planned tasks are feasible and meet the requirements.
- The sub-agent component should enable the creation and management of specialized agents that can handle specific tasks or domains.
- The file system access component should provide a secure and efficient way to read and write files, as well as manage file metadata.
- The memory management component should implement a caching mechanism to store and retrieve information efficiently, as well as support for long-term memory storage.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples for each component that is exported.
- Unit tests for each component to ensure reliability and maintainability.
- Use Git for version control and collaboration with clear commit messages.
- A clear versioning strategy (e.g., semantic versioning) to manage changes and updates.
- Support for both CommonJS and ES Module syntax.

User Experience Design:

- The user interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly access the features they need.
- Provide clear feedback to users when they perform actions, such as launching tasks or managing agents.

Check off items in the plan as they are completed as we accomplish them like a todo list.   If you have any open questions about the requirements, ask them before we start.
